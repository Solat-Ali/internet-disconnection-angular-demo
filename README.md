# Network Status Check Demo

This is a simple Angular application which demonstrates real-time network status check using RxJS. 

## How To Test: 
Just open the network tab, go to Network -> Throttling and toggle between "Offline" and "Online" options to see the output. The network monitoring logic is written within `network-status.service` file. If you would want to execute any additional checks, use the `tap` section of RxJS `merge` stream.
